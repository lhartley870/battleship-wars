* [Python code in run.py file result](/readme-documents/validator-results/validator-clear.png)

Initially when the project was run through the validator the following errors were shown:
+ [Python code in run.py file initial result](/readme-documents/validator-results/validator-warnings.png).
* These were all errors for the same issue and stated the issue to be *'line break before binary operator'*. This was resolved by moving the applicable lines breaks to after the binary operators, in all cases the binary operator being a '+'.
