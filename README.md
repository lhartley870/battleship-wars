# Battleship Wars
Battleship Wars is a Python terminal game, which runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.

The player plays against the computer to try and find all of the computer's battleships before the computer finds all of the player's ships. Each battleship is 2 spaces long on a board and is either placed horizontally or vertically at random. This game will be useful for battleships/game enthusiasts as the computer has been programmed to think like a human when the computer gets a hit, so making the experience as close to playing a real human as possible.

## How to Play
Battleship Wars is based on the classic board game which was originally a pen and paper game but then became popular as a board game by Milton Bradley. You can find out more about the game on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)).

In this application the player enters their name and two boards are generated. The boards are 10 spaces by 10 spaces. The columns are marked A-J and the rows are marked 1-10. Each space on the boards is represented with a dot. The letters, numbers and board dots all appear in white.

The player and computer each have 5 ships of 2 spaces long on their boards. The player's ships are revealed on the player's board; the computer's ships are concealed on its board. The board spaces occupied by player's ships are represented by the letter 'S' which is coloured green. The ships are randomly placed either horizontally or vertically, never diagonally. The player is also informed that two ships will also not be placed directly next to each other either horizontally or vertically on the board.

The player goes first and guesses a coordinate on the board e.g. 1A. The computer then takes a guess. If a guess is a hit then a red '*' symbol appears at the relevant board space and the player receives 1 point. A miss is represented by a '0' which is coloured yellow and receives 0 points. 

The player and computer continue to take turns making guesses until one player sinks all 5 of the other player's battleships, reaching a score of 10 and winning the game. If both the computer and the player reach a score of 10 during the last round of the game, the game is a draw.
