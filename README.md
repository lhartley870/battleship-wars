# Battleship Wars
Battleship Wars is a Python terminal game, which runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.

The player plays against the computer to try and find all of the computer's battleships before the computer
finds all of the player's ships. Each battleship is 2 spaces long on a board and is either placed horizontally
or vertically at random. This game will be useful for battleships/game enthusiasts as the computer has been programmed
to think like a human when the computer gets a hit, so making the experience as close to playing a real human as possible.
